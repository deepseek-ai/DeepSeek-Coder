Let's use python to solve math problems.

Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

```python
def solution():
    """Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?"""
    money_initial = 23
    bagels = 5
    bagel_cost = 3
    money_spent = bagels * bagel_cost
    money_left = money_initial - money_spent
    result = money_left
    return result
```

Question: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?

```python
def solution():
    """Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?"""
    golf_balls_initial = 58
    golf_balls_lost_tuesday = 23
    golf_balls_lost_wednesday = 2
    golf_balls_left = golf_balls_initial - golf_balls_lost_tuesday - golf_balls_lost_wednesday
    result = golf_balls_left
    return result
```

Question: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?

```python
def solution():
    """There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?"""
    computers_initial = 9
    computers_per_day = 5
    num_days = 4  # 4 days between monday and thursday
    computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
    computers_total = computers_initial + computers_added
    result = computers_total
    return result
